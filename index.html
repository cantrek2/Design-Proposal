    <p>Short Written Abstract
        As people browse the internet, the sites and web services they visit collect and use the users data. But many people may not know how their data is collected and used, even when it's immediately used to give them a different experience than other users. While there is an individual user's privacy aspect to this, our project will focus on the privacy of the group data. For larger amounts of traffic, the data sites collect can be used to identify key groups in users, and perform an analysis of them in relation to other users. The sites can then give an altered page for specific groups of people, such as using dynamic product pricing to charge higher costs for people who are more likely to be willing and able to pay more. So in order to demonstrate, and bring awareness to this, our project will perform similar methods to use a group's data. Our site will do this by first taking specific information about the user, then records the user's response to a couple questions, and lastly shows statistics on all the users who have visited the site in comparison to the current user.
        Introduce the Problem 
        The main problem space this project is addressing is the collection and use of data on people who browse the internet. More specifically, the data in terms of groups. For any given person, this data can be used to make predictions about them (), give them targeted sites (wiki Targeted advertising), and even change product prices (wnycstudios), all based on what type of person they are.
        To start, we will look at the data. The types of data collected and the methods of collecting it. According to Business News Daily, there are four main types of customer data that businesses try to collect: Personal, Engagement, Behavioral, and Attitudinal data. The information personal data includes both personally identifiable(SSN, IDs), as well as non personally identifiable(IP, cookies, device IDs). Engagement data can show how a customer uses the businesses platforms. Behavioral data includes purchases, and product usage. Attitudinal data is customer satisfaction, purchase criteria, etc. There are multiple ways to collect this data. Again from Business News Daily, a business has three ways to collect this data: directly asking, tracking, and meshing other sources of the customers data with their own.
        Now, looking at how this data is used. One of the most obvious cases of this is seen in search engine advertisement targeting, where users will get ads on various sites, based on their specific web search history (). Or even organizations such as Google, using your data from Youtube to base recommendations and results on other Google owned platforms (toolbox). Another, less apparent way is to use this data in conjunction with third party APIs and/or web scraping (datahut) to adjust product prices based on the user visiting. Dynamic pricing is where an online store offers people prices that they are more likely to be willing to pay (wnycstudios).
        Design Concept 
        We have a few core portions of our design. The arguably first and most important is gathering our generic data. This will ideally be from using a method of web scraping in which we use a Facebook development API to gather data from friends lists and other ways that the website groups people. This method, or similar, is used by websites tangential to our goal.  
        Websites like Facebook Audience Insight which uses said methods to determine the demographic of people who are on your page, and in general are on Facebook. Listing things like gender, age, orientation, job, etc. This is mostly for finding out what your target demographic is, who you should advertise to, and
